# Bert_base_job_matching
This repo is to implement a model solution for the job matching competition. 
We pretrained a bert-base model and fine-tuned it using the dataset provided by iFLYTEK. I will add more details in the future.

Frameworks: pytorch + transformers + accelerator
Pretraining requirement: 2 * Nvidia A-100 GPU 40G in the GPUSHARE platform.
